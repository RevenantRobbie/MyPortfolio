        Hi, I'm Aidan. I'm a high school student into all things computers, coding, and cybersecurity. I also do a fair share of 3d modeling and animation in my spare time too.

      <p class = "bodyParagraph">
         I am a intermediate level coder with experience in Python and Lua. I also have some basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, SQL, and Java. I'm also always open to learning new coding languages and discovering new tricks with old ones.

      <p class = "bodyParagraph">
        I also have experience with CTFs and am looking for a team to join. I currently specialize in a little bit of cryptography and web exploitation although I wouldn't call myself experienced in either. I also run the Blake School Cybersecurity Club every Friday morning so please drop by when you have the oppertunity!
